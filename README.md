# MIPS-Binary-Search-Tree
Uses MIPS Assembly Language to create a Binary Search Tree to evaluate expressions and traverse the tree to perform multiple operations on it.

### Operations
 - Stack based conversion from infix to postfix

 - Preorder traversal

 - Calculate the numerical result of the expression

### How to Run

 - Install QtSpim or an equivalent software to run .asm files

 - Press "Reinitialize and Load File" button at top of screen (*should be the second button on the tool bar)

 - Press Run and enter you infix expression to be evaluated
 - There may be some trouble loading and initializing, if you do run into this, just restart QtSpim and go through the steps again.
